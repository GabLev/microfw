Todo list
=========

List of things to work on:

* Change the models to better use PDO and remove dependency on mysql.
* Implement layouting in views and add "decorators/components/blocks".
* Simplify syntax for calls in templates (frontend devs shouldn't have to use object syntax i think).
* Add support for things like less & other 3rd party modules.
* Composer integration.
* Was thinking of maybe putting the core in a phar.
* Find out exatcly what the damn fox says.
* Support multiple translation files with the translation engine.
